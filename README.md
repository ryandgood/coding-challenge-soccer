# Coding Challenge Soccer

This implements the scoring code challenge described in ORIGINAL_README.md.

## Running

This has been implemented in Python 3 and should not require any extra
dependencies, as everything used is in the stdlib.

### Main script

```
python3 main.py
```

### Unit tests

```
python3 -m unittest tests/test.py
```
